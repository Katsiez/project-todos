# Project Todos✏️📋

This week's project was to build a To-do app using the Redux Toolkit!
By creating a Store for this project, I was able to manipulate the state, in order to add, remove and clear all tasks. Doing this from scratch was pretty cool.😎

## Code

After creating my Store, I went ahead and created different components for each individual section of my To-do app. 
Since the components were plenty, I kept all of my styled-components in respective files but one (Checkbox), since it seemed more manigable due to the app size I was working with. I ended up with a manigable amount of code per component. I was pretty happy to have decided to transition from CSS to using Styled-components. Felt like an accomplishment!

For this project, I have used:

🧩 React
🧠 Redux
💅 Styled components😇
